# Couplings

The designs of Mount_Kuka-Youbot.SLDPRT, dovetail_famele.SLDPRT and dovetail_made.SLDPRT are taken from [Yale Openhand Project](https://github.com/grablab/openhand-hardware/tree/master/couplings), thank you!

The design of MountPA10.SLDASM is specific for our flange for the Mitsubishi PA10 robotic arm.
