# Robot Hands CAD files

In this folder we provide appropriate 3D models (Solidworks .SLDASM .SLDPRT), laser cut files (.dxf) and files for 3d printer (.stl)
in order to replicate the proposed designs.

# Design and Fabrication Parameters

The designs of parts (Solidworks .SLDASM .SLDPRT) are parametric. Thus, the user could choose the appropiate dimensions that he wants.
A guide by which inspired is [here](http://www.eng.yale.edu/grablab/openhand/OpenHand%20CAD%20Guide.pdf). The picture below and tables
show the parameters and limits of the values.

#####Design Parameters
	Name of parameter: limits, default value
	Width of Phalanxs, Wph (mm): 16 - 30, 20
	Length of Proximal Phalanx, Lp (mm): 24 - , 40
	Length of Distal Phalanx, Ld (mm): 18 - , 35
	Transmission radii of Proximal, rp (mm): 7.8 - , 8
	Transmission radii of Distal, rd (mm):7.8 - , 8
	Thickness of Proximal Flexure Joint, Tjointp (mm): 2 - 6, 4
	Thickness of Distal Flexure Joint, Tjointd (mm): 2 - 6, 5
	Length of Proximal Flexure Joint, Ljointp (mm): 6 - 16, 10
	Lenght of Distal Flexure Joint, Ljointd (mm): 6 - 16, 10
	Width of flexure Joints, Wjoint (mm): 16 - 30, 20
	Initial angle between Finger Base and robot Base, Tb (degrees): 20 - 45, 45
	Initial angle between Finger Base and Proximal, Tp (degrees): 0 - 30, 8
	Initial angle between Proximal and Distal, Td (degrees): 0 - 30, 8
	Finger opposition length, Lb (mm): 45 - 55, 45

#####Fabrication Parameters
	print fit, print_fit (mm): 0.2
	print free, print_free (mm): 0.45
	cut free, cut_free (mm): 0.2
	radii fit, radii_fit (mm): 0.2

In order to print or cut the parts in correct dimensions is necessary to add in design the above parameters.
